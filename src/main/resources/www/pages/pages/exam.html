            In many forms of dance (ballet, ballroom dance, concert dance) medal examinations are held. They are
            organised by leading dance teaching organisations, such as
        <ul class="exam__org-list">
            <li class="exam__org">
                The Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing
                (ISTD),
            </li>
            <li class="exam__org">
                The International Dance Teachers Association (IDTA),
            </li>
            <li class="exam__org">
                Other organizations
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="exam__text">
            The examinations are a way for a young dancer to mark their progress in the art of dance. They have been
            extremely popular since their introduction in the early 1930s. They are not a form of professional
            qualification. Professional qualifications are also offered by the same organisations, and they are much
            more extensive and demanding.
            <br>
            During a medal test, a dancer will either dance alone (ballet) or be partnered by their teacher (ballroom).
            An examiner, appointed by the examining body, will observe the performance, and mark it.
            <br>
            Depending upon the level and style of the examination, a student might be asked to demonstrate anywhere from
            one to five different dances, all within one discipline, such as <strong>'Standard'</strong> , or
            <strong>'Latin American'</strong> . That is
            because medals are awarded within disciplines.
            <br>
            For example, at Bronze level, a Latin American dance student
            might be asked to dance Cha-cha-cha, Samba and Rumba, whilst the same student would definitely be asked to
            dance all five International Latin dances at Gold level. A single dance will take up around 60 to 90
            seconds; the entire exam, allowing for short breaks between routines, will be between five and ten minutes,
            depending on the number of dances. Typically, a studio will have a large number of candidates, all examined
            on the same day.
            <br>
            There is a separate set of tests for student dance teachers, which involves
            <br>
            a) dancing
            <br>
            b) explaining theory
            <br>
            c) demonstrating the ability to teach, including the ability to demonstrate steps of both male and female
            partners. These are not medal tests, but are often adjudicated in a similar setting by the same examiners on
            the same day.
